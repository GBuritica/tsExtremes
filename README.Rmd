# R Package tutorial


The outline of this tutorial is as follows:

1. Tail index inference
    - In this vignette we demonstrate how to obtain unbiased estimates of the tail index alpha of the series. We use the recipricate of Hill-type estimators in [@dehaan:mercadier:zhou:2016]
2. Cluster inference 
    - In this window we show how to compute the cluster process based estimates in [@buritica:meyer:mikosch:wintenberger:2021] for classical cluster statics. We consider the example of inference of the extremal index with the alpha cluster process [@buritica:mikosch:wintenberger:2021], and also an example of the cluster lengths.
