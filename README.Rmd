# tsExtremes

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The package tsExtremes gathers functions for analyzing the extremes of stationary time series and assessing the time dependencies of extremes.

For example, you can use it compute estimates of:

-   the tail index of the series,

-   the extremal index of a time series,

-   the cluster lengths of the time series.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of tsExtremes from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

To get started, install the package from Github using the command:

``` r
devtools::install_github('GBuritica/tsExtremes')
```

# R Package tutorial

The outline of this tutorial is as follows:

1.  Tail index inference
    -   In this vignette you can learn how to compute unbiased estimates of the tail index alpha of the series. The implementation is based on the Hill-type estimators in [@dehaan:mercadier:zhou:2016].
2.  Cluster inference
    -   In this window you will learn how to compute the cluster process based estimates in [@buritica:meyer:mikosch:wintenberger:2021] for classical cluster statics. We consider the example of inference of the extremal index with the alpha cluster process [@buritica:mikosch:wintenberger:2021], and also an example of the cluster lengths.
